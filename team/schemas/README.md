# Schemas

JSON Schemas for core artifacts used by the team. These are intentionally permissive to allow iteration while keeping
required top-level fields consistent with the operating model.

Includes `playbook.schema.json` for playbook metadata validation.

Files live under `team/schemas/` and map to templates in `team/templates/`.
